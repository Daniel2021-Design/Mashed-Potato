Step 1: Cut the potatoes.  Again, feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on.  (I always leave them on for the extra nutrients and flavor.)  Then cut your potatoes into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick.  Then transfer them to a large stockpot full of cold water until all of the potatoes are cut and ready to go.

Step 2: Boil the potatoes.  Once all of your potatoes are cut, be sure that there is enough cold water in the pan so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes.  Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon salt to the water.  Then turn on high heat until the water comes to a boil.  And boil the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes in with almost no resistance.  

Step 3: Carefully drain out all of the water.

Step 4: Prepare your melted butter mixture.  Meanwhile, as the potatoes are boiling, heat your butter, milk and an additional 2 teaspoons of sea salt together either in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted.  (You want to avoid boiling the milk.)  Set aside until ready to use.

Step 5: Mash the potatoes.  Using your preferred kind of masher (see above), mash the potatoes to your desired consistency.

Step 6: Stir everything together.  Then pour half of the melted butter mixture over the potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked up the liquid.  Repeat with the remaining butter.  

Final Step: Serve your delicious mashed potatoes! :) Enjoy!!!!!

Pro tip: If you are prepping ingredients for a big meal ahead of time, the potatoes can chill in the cold water for up to 4 hours before boiling.  Just add a few ice cubes to the water to be sure that it stays cold.
